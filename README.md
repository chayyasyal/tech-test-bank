## Tech Test 1: Bank
First practice tech test of week 10: Bank. To create a programme using Ruby or JavaScript that allows a customer to deposit and withdraw money from their account and print their bank statement to show current balance.
Time limit: 1030 - 1700

## About task
This is the first practice session of this week with an emphasis on producing the best code I can by myself when there is a minimal time pressure.
In this test I will practice OO design and TDD skills. At the end of the day I will also review my own code and reflect on the work I have done. I will share my thoughts in this document.

## Technologies used
1. JavaScript
2. Jasmine; testing framework
3. HTML
4. CSS 
5. TDD methodology

## Requirements
To interact with code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console. (There is no need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.) Deposits, withdrawal. Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing. Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything). Acceptance criteria
Given a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012 And a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012 And a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012 When she prints her bank statement Then she would see

````
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00

## Day 1 Test Reflections
I feel like the day got off to a good start as I managed to install the environment and my testing framework well. My spec tests were passing in both bankAccount and client files, but, I felt a bit cynical that my tests were passing quite quickly. So I created errors to test what I'd done - it felt too good to be true - but in the end I decided to commit any passing, green tests and have more faith in myself and my code.
As I went through the day, I ran into errors which put a stop to the influx of green tests. The error messages I mainly saw were: reference errors, type errors and having undefined variables. I resolved these by using a console log in my code, Googling my error messages and test driving any changes I'd made to my code. My errors turned out to be a mix of syntax errors and simply not referring to variables I had created.
My final update to Bank, which I have committed, has four specs which are all passing with the exception of one (it's passing at 86%).

## Further Features
I would have liked to feature more details to my programme. These include:
1. Adding a timestamp to transactions made
2. More HTML and CSS styling to the page
3. Have the Â£1000 deposit show up on the webpage when the 'view balance' button is clicked
